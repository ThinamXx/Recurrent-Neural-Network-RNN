## **Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)**
- A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

**Note:**
- All the Notebooks included in this repository presents the Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). These Notebooks are taken from the courses which I have completed from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Every Notebooks is the Implementation of RNN. You can get insights about Recurrent Neural Networks and it's implementation of real-world Projects like as:
